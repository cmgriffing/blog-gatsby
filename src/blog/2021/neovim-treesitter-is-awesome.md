We recently made a VSCode extension using tree sitter's WASM output. It worked so well we wondered what else we could do. It turns out that we can use tree sitter in neovim context. This make so much more stuff possible in an editor I don't even use.

Quick disclaimer: I dont CARE what you use. The entire point of this project is to point out the similarities between environments ad help dispel some of the "x vs y" of all of it.
