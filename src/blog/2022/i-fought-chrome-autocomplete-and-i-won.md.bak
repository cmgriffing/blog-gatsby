Chrome doesn't trust developers to make the right decisions regarding usernam/password inputs. I get it. However, I ran into an issue with it trying to autocomplete fields within the dashboard of an application I was making. These were public and secret keys for Stripe. They were NOT the login fields for the app itself, but Chrome totally thought they were.

## Examples of it being broken

Basically, any normal input next to a password input will trigger Chrome to try and do the right thing. In an application, this is most likely not the right thing. I needed to allow users to input a Stripe Publishable key and a Stripe Secret Key. Chrome autofilled the user's email and password instead.

## Things we tried

I looked at this stackoverflow post for guidance: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15738259/disabling-chrome-autofill](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15738259/disabling-chrome-autofill) and it didn't actually help. Chrome, at the time of this writing, ignores the autocomplete field.
