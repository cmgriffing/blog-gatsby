There are a few competitors to Firebase these days when it comes to developer experience. Appwrite jumped out because it is self-hosted. Preventing developers from getting locked into Firebase's pricing policies and changes sounds amazing. There are some horror stories online and I want to avoid that myself, too.

So, I checked out Appwrite and decided to try it out for a project. I'm not going to sugar coat it. I don't think it was ready for what I needed it to do. That said, the developers are working hard on it and already have fixes for some of my complaints in the works.

First off, lets get into some of the things I really liked about it.

- Extremely easy auth modules. You want Magic links instead of passwords? No problem. One button press.
- User/Team management built right in. Includes invite links.
- Fine-grained permissions for documents.

I can't emphasize enough how useful those aspects are. However, I ran into a few things that ended up making it something I couldn't use at this time for a project I planned on launching soon. They are working on it but I can't expect people to work on open source based on my schedule.

Before I go into the list of what I consider shortcomings, I have to stress that Appwrite is a really cool project and I expect that it will only get better from here. Do not let this sway you from trying it out. Just let this be a bit of a warning so that these issues don't come as a surprise.
